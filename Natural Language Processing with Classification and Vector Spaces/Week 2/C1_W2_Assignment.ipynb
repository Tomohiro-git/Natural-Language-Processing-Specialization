    "You will also implement a `lookup()` helper function that takes in the `freqs` dictionary, a word, and a label (1 or 0) and returns the number of times that word and label tuple appears in the collection of tweets.\n",

    "For example: given a list of tweets `[\"i am rather excited\", \"you are rather happy\"]` and the label 1, the function will return a dictionary that contains the following key-value pairs:\n",

    "{\n",
    "    (\"rather\", 1): 2\n",

    "- Notice how the words \"i\" and \"am\" are not saved, since it was removed by process_tweet because it is a stopword.\n",
    "- Notice how the word \"rather\" appears twice in the list of tweets, and so its count value is 2.\n",
